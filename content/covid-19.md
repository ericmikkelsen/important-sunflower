As Veterinary Services are considered essential businesses, Abbeywood Cat Hospital is remaining open for the time being.  However, we are making some changes to best comply with public health needs and recommendations.

First, in order to minimize person-to-person contact, we are asking that clients take advantage of our curbside service to allow us to retrieve their kitties for exams and services while clients remain in their cars.

Second, we would ask that anyone who is feeling any symptoms at all prioritize their own health and that of their community by staying home.

Beyond that, we will remain open in order to provide ongoing services, but we will continue to evaluate the situation on a daily basis.
